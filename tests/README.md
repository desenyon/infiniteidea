# Testing Infrastructure

This document describes the comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented for the Desenyon: InfiniteIdea project.

## Test Structure

The testing infrastructure includes four main categories of tests:

### 1. Unit Tests (Existing - Task 12.1 Complete)
- Located in `src/lib/__tests__/` and `src/components/**/__tests__/`
- Comprehensive coverage of AI orchestration, workflow generation, and UI components
- Uses Vitest with jsdom environment
- Includes mocking for external services

### 2. Integration Tests
- Located in `tests/integration/`
- Tests AI service integration with proper mocking
- Validates caching mechanisms and external tool integration
- Uses Vitest with comprehensive service mocking

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Located in `tests/e2e/`
- Uses Playwright for cross-browser testing
- Includes user journey testing and responsive design validation
- Supports visual regression testing

### 4. Performance Tests
- Located in `tests/performance/`
- Blueprint generation performance testing
- Concurrent request handling validation
- Memory usage and response time monitoring

### 5. Visual Regression Tests
- Located in `tests/visual/`
- UI component visual consistency testing
- Cross-browser and responsive layout validation
- Screenshot comparison for design consistency

## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration (`vitest.config.ts`)
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
})
```

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- Automatic screenshot and video capture on failures
- Built-in test server integration

## Available Test Scripts

```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:performance": "playwright test tests/performance",
  "test:visual": "playwright test tests/visual",
  "test:all": "npm run test:run && npm run test:e2e"
}
```

## Test Categories and Coverage

### Integration Tests
- **AI Service Integration**: Tests AI service manager, orchestrator, and fallback mechanisms
- **Caching Integration**: Validates Redis caching functionality
- **External Tool Integration**: Tests coding prompt generation and tool integration
- **Workflow Generation**: Validates AI workflow diagram generation

### End-to-End Tests
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete idea-to-blueprint generation flow
- **Authentication Flow**: User sign-in and protected route testing
- **Project Management**: Project creation, listing, and management
- **Error Handling**: API error scenarios and user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop layout testing

### Performance Tests
- **Blueprint Generation Performance**: Response time validation (< 60 seconds)
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Multi-user load testing
- **UI Responsiveness**: Interface performance during generation
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption monitoring
- **API Performance**: Rate limiting and response consistency

### Visual Regression Tests
- **Component Screenshots**: UI component visual consistency
- **Layout Testing**: Responsive design across viewports
- **Theme Variations**: Light/dark theme visual validation
- **Error States**: Error message and validation display
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators and animations

## Test Utilities

### Test Configuration (`tests/test-config.ts`)
- Centralized test configuration and constants
- Mock data for consistent testing
- Performance thresholds and timeouts
- Utility functions for common test operations

### Mock Data
- Comprehensive blueprint mock data
- AI service response mocking
- User authentication mocking
- External API response simulation

## Running Tests

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run visual regression tests
npm run test:visual
```

### CI/CD Testing
```bash
# Run all tests for CI
npm run test:all

# Generate test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with reporting
npm run test:run -- --reporter=junit
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Playwright browsers installed (`npx playwright install`)
- Environment variables for testing:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=test-key`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=test-key`
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=test-url`

### Mock Services
All external services are properly mocked in tests:
- OpenAI API responses
- Anthropic API responses
- Redis caching operations
- NextAuth authentication
- External tool integrations

## Test Reports

### HTML Reports
- Playwright generates HTML reports with screenshots and videos
- Vitest UI provides interactive test results
- Coverage reports show code coverage metrics

### CI Integration
- JUnit XML reports for CI systems
- JSON reports for programmatic analysis
- Performance metrics tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation with proper setup/teardown
2. **Mocking**: External services are mocked to ensure reliability
3. **Performance**: Tests include performance assertions and monitoring
4. **Visual**: UI tests include visual regression testing
5. **Documentation**: All test utilities and configurations are documented

## Future Enhancements

1. **Load Testing**: Add comprehensive load testing for production scenarios
2. **Security Testing**: Implement security-focused test scenarios
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Add automated accessibility testing
4. **API Contract Testing**: Implement API contract validation
5. **Database Testing**: Add database integration and migration testing

This testing infrastructure provides comprehensive coverage for the Desenyon: InfiniteIdea application, ensuring reliability, performance, and user experience quality across all features and platforms.
