```bash
# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Verify production deployment
npm run deploy:monitor

# Monitor for 15 minutes
# Check error rates, response times, and user feedback
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Health check
curl -f https://desenyon-infinite-idea.vercel.app/api/health

# Test critical user flows

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on your production deployment!**

Remember to monitor closely for the first 24-48 hours and be prepared to rollback if critical issues arise. The automated monitoring and alerting will help catch issues early, but manual verification of key user flows is also important.

For ongoing support and maintenance, refer to the [Monitoring Guide](./MONITORING.md) and [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md).
